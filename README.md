# Effective-Fortnight

## Description

This project uses Mongoose with an MVC structure to build up prototypical CRUD operations for social media. You can create new users and associate "thoughts" with them, add friends, and react to "thoughts". You can also remove users, friends, thoughts, and reactions.

## Installation

After downloading or cloning the repository, type `npm run start` to get the server running (or, if you prefer, `npm run dev` for nodemon). Then use a program like Insomnia to send CRUD requests to the server.
